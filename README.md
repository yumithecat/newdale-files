<h3><b>2.How can i use this?</b></h3>
You can use this for dowloads in your small community. This is the one-server-reduced version of the files website. You need to know some HTML and CSS (maybe JS too) tho, as i won't help you modify this for your own needs! The css reference for w3.css is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/default.asp">Right here!</a>

<h3>Have fun using this! 🎉</h3>
